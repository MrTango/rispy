AB  - For the purpose of this review, 'time-lapse' refers to the reconstruction of
      ancestral (in this case dinosaur) karyotypes using genome assemblies of extant
      species. Such reconstructions are only usually possible when genomes are
      assembled to 'chromosome level' i.e. a complete representation of all the
      sequences, correctly ordered contiguously on each of the chromosomes. Recent
      paleontological evidence is very clear that birds are living dinosaurs, the
      latest example of dinosaurs emerging from a catastrophic extinction event.
      Non-avian dinosaurs (ever present in the public imagination through art, and
      broadcast media) emerged some 240 million years ago and have displayed incredible
      phenotypic diversity. Here we report on our recent studies to infer the overall
      karyotype of the Theropod dinosaur lineage from extant avian chromosome level
      genome assemblies. Our work first focused on determining the likely karyotype of
      the avian ancestor (most likely a chicken-sized, two-legged, feathered, land
      dinosaur from the Jurassic period) finding karyotypic similarity to the chicken.
      We then took the work further to determine the likely karyotype of the
      bird-lizard ancestor and the chromosomal changes (chiefly translocations and
      inversions) that occurred between then and modern birds. A combination of
      bioinformatics and cross-species fluorescence in situ hybridization (zoo-FISH)
      uncovered a considerable number of translocations and fissions from a
      'lizard-like' genome structure of 2n = 36-46 to one similar to that of
      soft-shelled turtles (2n = 66) from 275 to 255 million years ago (mya).
      Remarkable karyotypic similarities between some soft-shelled turtles and chicken
      suggests that there were few translocations from the bird-turtle ancestor (plus
      ∼7 fissions) through the dawn of the dinosaurs and pterosaurs, through the
      theropod linage and on to most to modern birds. In other words, an avian-like
      karyotype was in place about 240mya when the dinosaurs and pterosaurs first
      emerged. We mapped 49 chromosome inversions from then to the present day,
      uncovering some gene ontology enrichment in evolutionary breakpoint regions. This
      avian-like karyotype with its many (micro)chromosomes provides the basis for
      variation (the driver of natural selection) through increased random segregation
      and recombination. It may therefore contribute to the ability of dinosaurs to
      survive multiple extinction events, emerging each time as speciose and diverse.

AB  - Extant terrestrial vertebrates, including birds, have a panoply of symbiotic
      relationships with many insects and arachnids, such as parasitism or mutualism.
      Yet, identifying arthropod-vertebrate symbioses in the fossil record has been
      based largely on indirect evidence; findings of direct association between
      arthropod guests and dinosaur host remains are exceedingly scarce. Here, we
      present direct and indirect evidence demonstrating that beetle larvae fed on
      feathers from an undetermined theropod host (avian or nonavian) 105 million y
      ago. An exceptional amber assemblage is reported of larval molts (exuviae)
      intimately associated with plumulaceous feather and other remains, as well as
      three additional amber pieces preserving isolated conspecific exuviae. Samples
      were found in the roughly coeval Spanish amber deposits of El Soplao, San Just,
      and Peñacerrada I. Integration of the morphological, systematic, and taphonomic
      data shows that the beetle larval exuviae, belonging to three developmental
      stages, are most consistent with skin/hide beetles (family Dermestidae), an
      ecologically important group with extant keratophagous species that commonly
      inhabit bird and mammal nests. These findings show that a symbiotic relationship
      involving keratophagy comparable to that of beetles and birds in current
      ecosystems existed between their Early Cretaceous relatives.

AB  - A predominantly fish-eating diet was envisioned for the sail-backed theropod
      dinosaur Spinosaurus aegyptiacus when its elongate jaws with subconical teeth
      were unearthed a century ago in Egypt. Recent discovery of the high-spined tail
      of that skeleton, however, led to a bolder conjecture that S. aegyptiacus was the
      first fully aquatic dinosaur. The 'aquatic hypothesis' posits that S. aegyptiacus
      was a slow quadruped on land but a capable pursuit predator in coastal waters,
      powered by an expanded tail. We test these functional claims with skeletal and
      flesh models of S. aegyptiacus. We assembled a CT-based skeletal reconstruction
      based on the fossils, to which we added internal air and muscle to create a
      posable flesh model. That model shows that on land S. aegyptiacus was bipedal and
      in deep water was an unstable, slow-surface swimmer (<1 m/s) too buoyant to dive.
      Living reptiles with similar spine-supported sails over trunk and tail are used
      for display rather than aquatic propulsion, and nearly all extant secondary
      swimmers have reduced limbs and fleshy tail flukes. New fossils also show that
      Spinosaurus ranged far inland. Two stages are clarified in the evolution of
      Spinosaurus, which is best understood as a semiaquatic bipedal ambush piscivore
      that frequented the margins of coastal and inland waterways.

AB  - Recently, a set of publications described flea fossils from Jurassic and Early
      Cretaceous geological strata in northeastern China, which were suggested to have
      parasitized feathered dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and early birds or mammals. In
      support of these fossils being fleas, a recent publication in BMC Evolutionary
      Biology described the extended abdomen of a female fossil specimen as due to
      blood feeding.We here comment on these findings, and conclude that the current
      interpretation of the evolutionary trajectory and ecology of these putative
      dinosaur fleas is based on appeal to probability, rather than evidence. Hence,
      their taxonomic positioning as fleas, or stem fleas, as well as their ecological
      classification as ectoparasites and blood feeders is not supported by currently
      available data.

TI  - Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism.
PG  - 117-55
LID - 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00137.x [doi]
AB  - The herbivorous sauropod dinosaurs of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods were
      the largest terrestrial animals ever, surpassing the largest herbivorous mammals
      by an order of magnitude in body mass. Several evolutionary lineages among
      Sauropoda produced giants with body masses in excess of 50 metric tonnes by
      conservative estimates. With body mass increase driven by the selective
      advantages of large body size, animal lineages will increase in body size until
      they reach the limit determined by the interplay of bauplan, biology, and
      resource availability. There is no evidence, however, that resource availability
      and global physicochemical parameters were different enough in the Mesozoic to
      have led to sauropod gigantism. We review the biology of sauropod dinosaurs in
      detail and posit that sauropod gigantism was made possible by a specific
      combination of plesiomorphic characters (phylogenetic heritage) and evolutionary
      innovations at different levels which triggered a remarkable evolutionary
      cascade. Of these key innovations, the most important probably was the very long
      neck, the most conspicuous feature of the sauropod bauplan. Compared to other
      herbivores, the long neck allowed more efficient food uptake than in other large
      herbivores by covering a much larger feeding envelope and making food accessible
      that was out of the reach of other herbivores. Sauropods thus must have been able
      to take up more energy from their environment than other herbivores. The long
      neck, in turn, could only evolve because of the small head and the extensive
      pneumatization of the sauropod axial skeleton, lightening the neck. The small
      head was possible because food was ingested without mastication. Both mastication
      and a gastric mill would have limited food uptake rate. Scaling relationships
      between gastrointestinal tract size and basal metabolic rate (BMR) suggest that
      sauropods compensated for the lack of particle reduction with long retention
      times, even at high uptake rates. The extensive pneumatization of the axial
      skeleton resulted from the evolution of an avian-style respiratory system,
      presumably at the base of Saurischia. An avian-style respiratory system would
      also have lowered the cost of breathing, reduced specific gravity, and may have
      been important in removing excess body heat. Another crucial innovation inherited
      from basal dinosaurs was a high BMR. This is required for fueling the high growth
      rate necessary for a multi-tonne animal to survive to reproductive maturity. The
      retention of the plesiomorphic oviparous mode of reproduction appears to have
      been critical as well, allowing much faster population recovery than in
      megaherbivore mammals. Sauropods produced numerous but small offspring each
      season while land mammals show a negative correlation of reproductive output to
      body size. This permitted lower population densities in sauropods than in
      megaherbivore mammals but larger individuals. Our work on sauropod dinosaurs thus
      informs us about evolutionary limits to body size in other groups of herbivorous
      terrestrial tetrapods. Ectothermic reptiles are strongly limited by their low
      BMR, remaining small. Mammals are limited by their extensive mastication and
      their vivipary, while ornithsichian dinosaurs were only limited by their
      extensive mastication, having greater average body sizes than mammals.

AB  - The Frankfurt specimen of the early-branching ceratopsian dinosaur Psittacosaurus
      is remarkable for the exquisite preservation of squamous (scaly) skin and other
      soft tissues that cover almost its entire body. New observations under
      Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence (LSF) reveal the complexity of the squamous skin of
      Psittacosaurus, including several unique features and details of newly detected
      and previously-described integumentary structures. Variations in the scaly skin
      are found to be strongly regionalized in Psittacosaurus. For example, feature
      scales consist of truncated cone-shaped scales on the shoulder, but form a
      longitudinal row of quadrangular scales on the tail. Re-examined through LSF, the
      cloaca of Psittacosaurus has a longitudinal opening, or vent; a condition that it
      shares only with crocodylians. This implies that the cloaca may have had
      crocodylian-like internal anatomy, including a single, ventrally-positioned
      copulatory organ. Combined with these new integumentary data, a comprehensive
      review of integument in ceratopsian dinosaurs reveals that scalation was
      generally conservative in ceratopsians and typically consisted of large
      subcircular-to-polygonal feature scales surrounded by a network of smaller
      non-overlapping polygonal basement scales. This study highlights the importance
      of combining exceptional specimens with modern imaging techniques, which are
      helping to redefine the perceived complexity of squamation in ceratopsians and
      other dinosaurs.

AB  - Dinosaurs and mammals have coexisted for the last ~ 230 million years. Both
      groups arose during the Late Triassic and diversified throughout the Mesozoic and
      into the Cenozoic (the latter in the form of birds). Although they undoubtedly
      interacted in many ways, direct fossil evidence for their interaction is rare.
      Here we report a new fossil find from the Lujiatun Member of the Lower Cretaceous
      Yixian Formation of China, showing a gobiconodontid mammal and psittacosaurid
      dinosaur locked in mortal combat. We entertain various hypothesized explanations
      for this association, but the balance of the evidence suggests that it represents
      a predation attempt on the part of the smaller mammal, suddenly interrupted by,
      and preserved within, a lahar-type volcanic debris flow. Mesozoic mammals are
      usually depicted as having lived in the shadows of their larger dinosaurian
      contemporaries, but this new fossil convincingly demonstrates that mammals could
      pose a threat even to near fully-grown dinosaurs. The Yixian Formation-and the
      Chinese fossil Jehol Biota more broadly-have played a particularly important role
      in revealing the diversity of small-bodied dinosaurs and other fauna. We
      anticipate that the volcanically derived obrution deposits specific to the
      Lujiatun Member will likewise continue to yield evidence for biotic interactions
      otherwise unknown from the rest of the fossil record.

AB  - The Triassic (252-201 Ma) marks a major punctuation in Earth history, when
      ecosystems rebuilt themselves following the devastating Permian-Triassic mass
      extinction. Herbivory evolved independently several times as ecosystems
      comprising diverse assemblages of therapsids, parareptiles and archosauromorphs
      rose and fell, leading to a world dominated by dinosaurs. It was assumed that
      dinosaurs prevailed either through long-term competitive replacement of the
      incumbent clades or rapidly and opportunistically following one or more
      extinction events. Here we use functional morphology and ecology to explore
      herbivore morphospace through the Triassic and Early Jurassic. We identify five
      main herbivore guilds (ingestion generalists, prehension specialists, durophagous
      specialists, shearing pulpers, and heavy oral processors), and find that
      herbivore clades generally avoided competition by almost exclusively occupying
      different guilds. Major ecosystem remodelling was triggered multiple times by
      external environmental challenges, and previously dominant herbivores were
      marginalised by newly emerging forms. Dinosaur dominance was a mix of opportunity
      following disaster, combined with competitive advantage in their new world.

TI  - Pterosaur melanosomes support signalling functions for early feathers.
PG  - 684-688
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-04622-3 [doi]
AB  - Remarkably well-preserved soft tissues in Mesozoic fossils have yielded
      substantial insights into the evolution of feathers(1). New evidence of branched
      feathers in pterosaurs suggests that feathers originated in the avemetatarsalian
      ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs in the Early Triassic(2), but the homology
      of these pterosaur structures with feathers is controversial(3,4). Reports of
      pterosaur feathers with homogeneous ovoid melanosome geometries(2,5) suggest that
      they exhibited limited variation in colour, supporting hypotheses that early
      feathers functioned primarily in thermoregulation(6). Here we report the presence
      of diverse melanosome geometries in the skin and simple and branched feathers of
      a tapejarid pterosaur from the Early Cretaceous found in Brazil. The melanosomes
      form distinct populations in different feather types and the skin, a feature
      previously known only in theropod dinosaurs, including birds. These
      tissue-specific melanosome geometries in pterosaurs indicate that manipulation of
      feather colour-and thus functions of feathers in visual communication-has deep
      evolutionary origins. These features show that genetic regulation of melanosome
      chemistry and shape(7-9) was active early in feather evolution.

AB  - Whether or not nonavian dinosaur biodiversity declined prior to the
      end-Cretaceous mass extinction remains controversial as the result of sampling
      biases in the fossil record, differences in the analytical approaches used, and
      the rarity of high-precision geochronological dating of dinosaur fossils. Using
      magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy, and biostratigraphy, we establish a
      high-resolution geochronological framework for the fossil-rich Late Cretaceous
      sedimentary sequence in the Shanyang Basin of central China. We have found only
      three dinosaurian eggshell taxa (Macroolithus yaotunensis, Elongatoolithus
      elongatus, and Stromatoolithus pinglingensis) representing two clades
      (Oviraptoridae and Hadrosauridae) in sediments deposited between ∼68.2 and ∼66.4
      million y ago, indicating sustained low dinosaur biodiversity, and that
      assessment is consistent with the known skeletal remains in the Shanyang and
      surrounding basins of central China. Along with the dinosaur eggshell records
      from eastern and southern China, we find a decline in dinosaur biodiversity from
      the Campanian to the Maastrichtian. Our results support a long-term decline in
      global dinosaur biodiversity prior to 66 million y ago, which likely set the
      stage for the end-Cretaceous nonavian dinosaur mass extinction.
