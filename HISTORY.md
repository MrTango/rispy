## v0.7.0 (2021-06-01)

New features:

* Allow for subclassing of readers and writers for custom implementations and greater flexibility; these custom classes can be used in all high-level commands (load/loads/dump/dumps)  (@scott-8 #36)
* Add encoding param to rispy.load if custom file encoding is needed (@scott-8 #36)
* Add convenience method to pretty-print reference type (@scott-8 #37)

* Added the ability to write RIS files (via `dump`) in addition to read (@J535D165)
* Code formatting rules via black and flake8
* All methods by default return an evaluated list of references, not a generator (to be consistent w/ load/dump behavior)

Breaking changes:

* Rename package from `RISparser` to `rispy`
* Revise API for reading RIS files to mirror python APIs (like `json`, `pickle`)
* `SE` RIS key mapped to `section` instead of `version` (per [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)))
